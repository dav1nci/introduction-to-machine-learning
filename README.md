# DataScience first steps
This is my programm asignments to "Введение в машинное обучение" course on coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/vvedenie-mashinnoe-obuchenie/home/info)

## Some interesting assignments

- SVC implementation of 'atheism' and 'space' text themes classification task ([notebook](https://github.com/dav1nci/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/text_analyse/main.ipynb))
- KNN scaled vs unscaled training set in 3 classes classification task ([notebook](https://github.com/dav1nci/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/knn/main.ipynb))
- k-means сlustering task in parrots image ([notebook](https://github.com/dav1nci/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/cluster/main.ipynb))
- gradient-boosting in gbm dataset ([notebook](https://github.com/dav1nci/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/grad_boosting/main.ipynb))
- lstm on mnist dataset ([notebook](https://github.com/dav1nci/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/lstm/main.ipynb))
- dota2 winner prediction (comming soon...)

and many others, but not so interesting as these.
